description: Use when writing, fixing, editing, or reviewing Python code quality. Enforces Clean Code's core principles—DRY, single responsibility, clear intent, no magic numbers, proper abstractions.
when_to_use: |
  Also trigger on: duplicated logic across files or branches (G5), magic numbers or hardcoded values (G25), long if/elif chains that should be polymorphism (G23), chained property access like `a.b.c.d` (G36), functions juggling multiple responsibilities (G30), clever one-liners whose intent is not obvious (G16).

# General Clean Code Principles

## Critical Rules

**G5: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

Every piece of knowledge has one authoritative representation.

```python
# Bad - duplication
tax_rate = 0.0825
ca_total = subtotal * 1.0825
ny_total = subtotal * 1.07

# Good - single source of truth
TAX_RATES = {"CA": 0.0825, "NY": 0.07}
def calculate_total(subtotal: float, state: str) -> float:
    return subtotal * (1 + TAX_RATES[state])
```

**G16: No Obscured Intent**

Don't be clever. Be clear.

```python
# Bad - what does this do?
return (x & 0x0F) << 4 | (y & 0x0F)

# Good - obvious intent
return pack_coordinates(x, y)
```

**G23: Prefer Polymorphism to If/Else**

```python
# Bad - will grow forever
def calculate_pay(employee):
    if employee.type == "SALARIED":
        return employee.salary
    elif employee.type == "HOURLY":
        return employee.hours * employee.rate
    elif employee.type == "COMMISSIONED":
        return employee.base + employee.commission

# Good - open/closed principle
class SalariedEmployee:
    def calculate_pay(self): return self.salary

class HourlyEmployee:
    def calculate_pay(self): return self.hours * self.rate

class CommissionedEmployee:
    def calculate_pay(self): return self.base + self.commission
```

**G25: Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants**

```python
# Bad
if elapsed_time > 86400:
    ...

# Good
SECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400
if elapsed_time > SECONDS_PER_DAY:
    ...
```

**G30: Functions Should Do One Thing**

If you can extract another function, your function does more than one thing.

**G36: Law of Demeter (Avoid Train Wrecks)**

```python
# Bad - reaching through multiple objects
output_dir = context.options.scratch_dir.absolute_path

# Good - one dot
output_dir = context.get_scratch_dir()
```
